# Analyze the space & time complexity of the following algorithm
## Problem

![Countdown](./images/Screenshot%202021-10-04%20at%2021.47.02.png)

### Time Complexity

**O(n)** - `countDown` will be called as many times as the size of `n`. If `n = 6`, then `print(n)` will be called
**6** times

### Space Complexity
**O(1)** - No auxiliary memory is required to execute the algorithm
